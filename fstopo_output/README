Results from the updated PC, svd_pc4_cmu in November, 2017. 

what's new: 

    1) used timeit.default_timer() in all the time-counting files.
    2) used svd_pc4.py,  which is the PC as described in the paper,
            using Sherman-Morrison, W=beta I to compute the augmented Lagrangian system

    3) Both the analytical problems, and the fstopo problem use svd_pc4.py as the Preconditioner 

        a) A switch self.fstopo = True or False, controls whether W = beta*I or W = BFGS approximation
        b) FSTOPO problem use W = beta*I, not W = BFGS, mainly because it is not possible (I think)
            to separate the bound constraint Jacobin with Stress Jacobian using W = BFGS PC formulation
